# Tutorial: Getting Started Developing a Chat app with the Swift SDK (iOS)

> Simple chat app to demonstrate the basic principles of creating a chat app with PubNub.  This app is written in Swift, targeting iOS and uses Swift UI for the user interface.

PubNub allows you to create chat apps from scratch or add them to your existing applications. You can focus on creating the best user experience while PubNub takes care of scalability, reliability, security, and global legislative compliance.

Create 1:1 private chat rooms, group chats, or mega chats for large scale events, for a variety of use cases.

> For the sake of simplicity, this application will only focus on a single 'group chat' room

## Demo

This application is not available on the app store but can be built and run locally in a simulator (or multiple simulators to show chat between multiple participants)

## Features

- [Publish and Subscribe](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift/api-reference/publish-and-subscribe) for messages with the PubNub Swift SDK
- Use [Presence](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift/api-reference/presence) APIs to determine who is currently chatting
- The [History](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift/api-reference/storage-and-playback#history) API will retrieve past messages for users newly joining the chat
- Assign a 'friendly name' to yourself which will be available to others via the PubNub [Object](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift/api-reference/objects) storage APIs
